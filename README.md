## Absolute Time for GitHub

Stop guessing what ‚Äú3 days ago‚Äù means when you‚Äôre debugging or reviewing changes. This extension replaces GitHub‚Äôs relative timestamps with absolute dates/times where it matters.

### Features
- Replaces `<relative-time>` with absolute dates across GitHub
- Resilient to SPA navigation (Turbo/PJAX) and dynamic DOM updates
- Zero tracking, zero network calls; settings sync via Chrome storage

### Installation
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click ‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù and select this folder

### What you'll see
- Recent events: concise dates
- Older events: include year

### Settings
- Popup: quick toggles (enable/disable, debug)
- Options:
  - dateStyle: short | medium | long (default short)
  - showWeekday: never | olderYears | always (default olderYears)
  - showTime: never | actionsOnly | always (default actionsOnly)

## üåç Where It Works

Pretty much everywhere GitHub uses `<relative-time>` elements:
- Commit timestamps
- Pull requests
- Comments
- Releases
- Actions/workflows
- Even those subtle "updated X ago" lines

### üéØ Smart Route Filtering

The extension is **intentionally disabled** on certain GitHub pages where precision matters less than context:

**Disabled on:**
- **Issues pages** (`/issues`) - Issue discussions are more conversational and community-focused
- **Discussions pages** (`/discussions`) - Community forums where relative time feels more natural

**Why?** These are thread-like, community-oriented spaces where "3 days ago" actually provides better social context than "Thu, Dec 15". When you're reading a discussion or issue thread, knowing something was "recently" or "a while back" often matters more than the exact timestamp.

**Enabled everywhere else** because commits, PRs, releases, and actions are where you need precision for debugging, deployment tracking, and technical decision-making.

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Why not just hover to see the time?**  \
A: Hovering is slow when you‚Äôre scanning lists. Absolute time is glanceable.

**Q: Doesn't GitHub show absolute time sometimes?**  
A: Inconsistently. And usually not when you're scanning a list of commits or comments.

**Q: Mobile support?**  
A: Chrome extensions don‚Äôt work on mobile. Complain to your browser vendor.

**Q: Can I contribute?**  \
A: Yes. Keep it simple.
